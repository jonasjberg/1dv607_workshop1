Running/Requirements
====================
Python v3.x is required to run this program. It will __NOT__ run with Python
2.x, which ships with MacOS and most Linux distributions by default.

This means you probably need to install Python 3 by yourself in order to run
this program from source.


The `build` directory contains *"compiled"* OS-specific versions, I.E. the
Python interpreter and any required packages have Been frozen and wrapped in
a OS-specific, native executable.


If you are having trouble getting it runningi --- Get in touch with me here
on GitHub, by e-mail, on slack, ..

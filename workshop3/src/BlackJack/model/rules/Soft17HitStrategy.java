/**
 * Created by Jonas Sj√∂berg (js224eh) on 2017-10-26.
 *
 * From the workshop instructions:
 *
 *  Soft 17 means that the dealer has 17 but in a combination of Ace and 6
 *  (for example Ace, two, two, two).
 *  This means that the Dealer can get another card valued at 10 but still
 *  have 17 as the value of the ace is reduced to 1.
 *
 *  Using the soft 17 rule the dealer should take another card (compared to the
 *  original rule when the dealer only takes cards on a score of 16 or lower).

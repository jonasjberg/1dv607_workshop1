I have really struggled with understanding this very strange way of designing
software. Coming from a background of mostly programming 8-bit PIC
microcontrollers and designing discrete logic, the all-encompassing
object-orientedness in the methodology does not come easy.

Everything does not belong in a class. Orienting the programming around
objects, as in \emph{Object-Oriented} Programming; just seems plain wrong and
limiting.  This kind of UML-modeling and OO-design just does not seem very
useful when implementing systems in a procedural style, with only a handful of
classes.

The abstract model often falls apart and become a tangled mess when attempting
to model the actually interesting parts, often ``cross-cutting concerns''. 

Most interesting problems and behaviours in non-trivial systems, where one
might benefit from modeling tools to aid in design and understanding --- are
cross-cutting\cite{youtube:blow-software-quality}.

Looking ahead, I will look at techniques to apply some of the object-oriented
modeling strategies to my way of thinking about programming, computing and
complex systems. Especially how this all relates to a non-object-oriented
approach.

\section{Analysis}
The analysis is based on the given problem description\ref{probdesc}.
All work has been done by Jonas Sjöberg, without collaborators.


\subsection{Analysis of Requirements for Grade 2}
This analysis delimits the domain model to the following requirements:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \ref{usecase1} Authenticate
  \item \ref{usecase4} Register Boat
  \item \ref{usecase5} Remove Boat
  \item \ref{usecase6} Change Boat
  \item \ref{usecase8} Assign Berths
  \item \ref{usecase10} Manage Calendar Event
  \item \ref{usecase11} List Calendar Events
  \item \ref{usecase12} Show Calendar Event
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Notes on the initial domain model}
The first domain model includes the concept of ``AccessControl'', just to
illustrate that the roles of ``Secretary'' and ``Treasurer'' are assumed to be
equivalent and are both treated as a form of ``Administrator''.

The administrators have elevated privileges, as compared to the ``Members''.



\subsection{Analysis of Requirements for Grade 3}
This analysis includes all of the requirements stated in the problem
description \ref{probdesc}.

\subsubsection{Notes on the initial domain model}
The biggest change is the introduction of a payment service provider.

Most of the other requirements involve presentation of various data or managing
data in certain ways.  This is restricted to the different user-levels,
administrators should be able to manage invoices, etc.  These requirements
could be modeled with ``description classes'', which have been omitted for
clarity.
